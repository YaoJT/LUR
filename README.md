# LUR

author: Jingtao Yao, CAU

applying a land use regression model to derive pollution or other related maps based on focalsum and raster system. The focal statistic method as well as correlation analysis method are used to find the optimum land use variables in land use types and various window sizes. Principle component analysis (PCA) is used to fulfill the no collinearity assumption of linear regression model. The leave-one-out cross validation method is used to compare the predict capability of the improved LUR model and other interpretation models.
